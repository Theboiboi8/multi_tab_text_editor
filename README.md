# Multi-Tab Text Editor

<subtitle>A text editor that supports syntax highlighting and multiple files open at once.</subtitle>

</div>

## Usage:

To get started, a stable Rust toolchain instalation is required.
The latest stable release is guaranteed to compile,
however older toolchain versions may still work,
though they have not been tested.

```shell
# Clone the git repo
git clone https://github.com/theboiboi8/multi_tab_text_editor.git
# Change working directory to the repo directory
cd multi_tab_text_editor
# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

Afterward, the text editor executable can be found under `target/release`
